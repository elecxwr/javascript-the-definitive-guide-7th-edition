# 第二章: 语法结构

语法是一门编程语言的基础，用来描述这门语言是如何使用的，作为语言的基础，它规定了变量是什么样子的，注释怎么写，两段语句之间如何分割，本章用很短的篇幅来介绍它们。

* 区分大小写，空格，换行符
* 注释
* 字面量
* 标识符和保留字
* Unicode 转义
* 可选的分号

## 2.1 区分大小写

JavaScript 这门语言是区分大小写的，也就是说关键字，变量，函数名和所有标识符都需要严格的使用原本的拼写，不能改变其中任何一个字符。比如关键字 `while` 必须写成 `while`，除此以外的任何拼写都是不对，如果写成 `While`，`WHILE`就是错误的。同样的原理， online ,  Online ,  OnLine , and  ONLINE 是代表四个不同的变量名，不要混淆使用。

JavaScript 代码之间可以使用任意个空格和换行符进行分割，为了代码的可读性，我们一般会通过缩进和换行来实现统一的代码风格。

除了普遍的空格符 (\u0020)以外，JavaScript 还可以用制表符(按Table键)，ASCII,Unicode空格来控制代码风格。JavaScript 会将换行符，回车识别为结束的符号。

## 2.2 注释

JavaScript 支持两种注释方式：

- `//`
    - 双斜线之后的所有内容都被被识别为注释
    - 这种注释方式因为只对单行有效果，所以也叫单行注释
- `/**/`
    - `/*` 和 `*/` 之间的内容，都会被当作注释
    - 这种注释方式可以用在多行，所以也叫多行注释
    - 注意:多行注释不能嵌套使用

下面都是合法的注释

```js
// 这是单行注释
/* 这是多行注释，也可以用于单行 */ // 这是另外一段是注释
/*
 * 这是多行注释，开头的 * 是非必需的，仅仅是为了让注释看起来更加美观和易读
 * 多行注释可以横跨多行
 */
```

## 2.3 字面量


所谓的字面量，就是程序中直接使用的数据，下面都是字面量:

```js
12              // 数值
1.2             // 小数，也有叫浮点数
"hello world"   // 字符串
'Hi'            // 字符串
true            // 布尔值
false           // 布尔值
null            // 空值  这个字面量在中文交流时，建议直接用英文的 null 进行交流
```

## 2.4 标识符和保留字

标识符仅仅就是一个名字，

An identifier is simply a name. In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name constants,
variables, properties, functions, and classes and to provide labels for certain loops in
JavaScript code. A JavaScript identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore ( _ ), or
a dollar sign ( $ ). Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar
signs. (Digits are not allowed as the first character so that JavaScript can easily distin‐
guish identifiers from numbers.) These are all legal identifiers:

```
i
my_variable_name
v13
_dummy
$str
```

Like any language, JavaScript reserves certain identifiers for use by the language itself.
These “reserved words” cannot be used as regular identifiers. They are listed in the
next section.

### 2.4.1 保留字

The following words are part of the JavaScript language. Many of these (such as  if ,
while , and  for ) are reserved keywords that must not be used as the names of con‐
stants, variables, functions, or classes (though they can all be used as the names of
properties within an object). Others (such as  from ,  of ,  get , and  set ) are used in limi‐
ted contexts with no syntactic ambiguity and are perfectly legal as identifiers. Still
other keywords (such as  let ) can’t be fully reserved in order to retain backward com‐
patibility with older programs, and so there are complex rules that govern when they
can be used as identifiers and when they cannot. ( let can be used as a variable name
if declared with  var outside of a class, for example, but not if declared inside a class or
with  const .) The simplest course is to avoid using any of these words as identifiers,
except for  from ,  set , and  target , which are safe to use and are already in common
use.


```
as      const       export      get         null    target  void
async   continue    extends     if          of      this    while
await   debugger    false       import      return  throw   with
break   default     finally     in          set     true    yield
case    delete      for         instanceof  static  try
catch   do          from        let         super   typeof
class   else        function    new         switch  var
```
JavaScript also reserves or restricts the use of certain keywords that are not currently used by the language but that might be used in future versions:

```
enum implements interface package private protected public
```

For historical reasons,  arguments and  eval are not allowed as identifiers in certain circumstances and are best avoided entirely.

## 2.5 Unicode 转义

JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set, and you can use any Unicode characters in strings and comments. For portability and ease of editing, it is common to use only ASCII letters and digits in identifiers. But this is a programming convention only, and the language allows Unicode letters, digits, and ideographs (but not emojis) in identifiers. This means that programmers can use mathematical sym‐bols and words from non-English languages as constants and variables:

```js
const π = 3.14;
const sí = true;
```

### 2.5.1 Unicode Escape Sequences
Some computer hardware and software cannot display, input, or correctly process the
full set of Unicode characters. To support programmers and systems using older tech‐
nology, JavaScript defines escape sequences that allow us to write Unicode characters
using only ASCII characters. These Unicode escapes begin with the characters  \u and
are either followed by exactly four hexadecimal digits (using uppercase or lowercase
letters A–F) or by one to six hexadecimal digits enclosed within curly braces. These
Unicode escapes may appear in JavaScript string literals, regular expression literals,
and identifiers (but not in language keywords). The Unicode escape for the character
“é,” for example, is  \u00E9 ; here are three different ways to write a variable name that
includes this character:

```js
let café = 1; // Define a variable using a Unicode character
caf\u00e9 // => 1; access the variable using an escape sequence
caf\u{E9} // => 1; another form of the same escape sequence
```

Early versions of JavaScript only supported the four-digit escape sequence. The ver‐
sion with curly braces was introduced in ES6 to better support Unicode codepoints
that require more than 16 bits, such as emoji:

```js
console.log("\u{1F600}"); // Prints a smiley face emoji
```

Unicode escapes may also appear in comments, but since comments are ignored, they
are simply treated as ASCII characters in that context and not interpreted as Unicode.

### 2.5.2 Unicode Normalization

If you use non-ASCII characters in your JavaScript programs, you must be aware that
Unicode allows more than one way of encoding the same character. The string “é,” for
example, can be encoded as the single Unicode character  \u00E9 or as a regular
ASCII “e” followed by the acute accent combining mark  \u0301 . These two encodings
typically look exactly the same when displayed by a text editor, but they have different
binary encodings, meaning that they are considered different by JavaScript, which
can lead to very confusing programs:

```js
const café = 1; // This constant is named "caf\u{e9}"
const café = 2; // This constant is different: "cafe\u{301}"
café // => 1: this constant has one value
café // => 2: this indistinguishable constant has a different value
```

The Unicode standard defines the preferred encoding for all characters and specifies a normalization procedure to convert text to a canonical form suitable for comparisons. JavaScript assumes that the source code it is interpreting has already been normalized and does not do any normalization on its own. If you plan to use Unicode characters in your JavaScript programs, you should ensure that your editor or some other tool performs Unicode normalization of your source code to prevent you from ending up with different but visually indistinguishable identifiers.

## 2.6 可选的分号

Like many programming languages, JavaScript uses the semicolon ( ; ) to separate
statements (see `Chapter 5`) from one another. This is important for making the mean‐
ing of your code clear: without a separator, the end of one statement might appear to
be the beginning of the next, or vice versa. In JavaScript, you can usually omit the
semicolon between two statements if those statements are written on separate lines.
(You can also omit a semicolon at the end of a program or if the next token in the
program is a closing curly brace:  } .) Many JavaScript programmers (and the code in
this book) use semicolons to explicitly mark the ends of statements, even where they
are not required. Another style is to omit semicolons whenever possible, using them
only in the few situations that require them. Whichever style you choose, there are a
few details you should understand about optional semicolons in JavaScript.

Consider the following code. Since the two statements appear on separate lines, the
first semicolon could be omitted:

```js
a = 3;
b = 4;
```

Written as follows, however, the first semicolon is required:

```js
a = 3; b = 4;
```

Note that JavaScript does not treat every line break as a semicolon: it usually treats
line breaks as semicolons only if it can’t parse the code without adding an implicit
semicolon. More formally (and with three exceptions described a bit later), JavaScript
treats a line break as a semicolon if the next nonspace character cannot be interpreted
as a continuation of the current statement. Consider the following code:


```js
let a
a
=
3
console.log(a)
```

JavaScript interprets this code like this:


```js
let a; a = 3; console.log(a);
```

JavaScript does treat the first line break as a semicolon because it cannot parse the
code  let a a without a semicolon. The second  a could stand alone as the statement
a; , but JavaScript does not treat the second line break as a semicolon because it can
continue parsing the longer statement  a = 3; .

These statement termination rules lead to some surprising cases. This code looks like
two separate statements separated with a newline:

```js
let y = x + f
(a+b).toString()
```


But the parentheses on the second line of code can be interpreted as a function invo‐
cation of  f from the first line, and JavaScript interprets the code like this:

```js
let y = x + f(a+b).toString();
```

More likely than not, this is not the interpretation intended by the author of the code.
In order to work as two separate statements, an explicit semicolon is required in this
case.

In general, if a statement begins with  ( ,  [ ,  / ,  + , or  - , there is a chance that it could be interpreted as a continuation of the statement before. Statements beginning with  / ,  + , and  - are quite rare in practice, but statements beginning with  ( and  [ are not
uncommon at all, at least in some styles of JavaScript programming. Some programmers like to put a defensive semicolon at the beginning of any such statement so that it will continue to work correctly even if the statement before it is modified and a previously terminating semicolon removed:

```js
let x = 0 // Semicolon omitted here
;[x,x+1,x+2].forEach(console.log) // Defensive ; keeps this statement separate
```

There are three exceptions to the general rule that JavaScript interprets line breaks as
semicolons when it cannot parse the second line as a continuation of the statement
on the first line. The first exception involves the  return ,  throw ,  yield ,  break , and
continue statements (see Chapter 5). These statements often stand alone, but they are
sometimes followed by an identifier or expression. If a line break appears after any of
these words (before any other tokens), JavaScript will always interpret that line break
as a semicolon. For example, if you write:

```js
return
true;
```

JavaScript assumes you meant:

```js
return; true;
```

However, you probably meant:

```js
return true;
```

This means that you must not insert a line break between  return ,  break , or  continue
and the expression that follows the keyword. If you do insert a line break, your code
is likely to fail in a nonobvious way that is difficult to debug.

The second exception involves the  ++ and  −− operators (`§4.8`). These operators can be
prefix operators that appear before an expression or postfix operators that appear
after an expression. If you want to use either of these operators as postfix operators,
they must appear on the same line as the expression they apply to. The third excep‐
tion involves functions defined using concise “arrow” syntax: the  => arrow itself must
appear on the same line as the parameter list.

## 2.7 小结

This chapter has shown how JavaScript programs are written at the lowest level. The
next chapter takes us one step higher and introduces the primitive types and values
(numbers, strings, and so on) that serve as the basic units of computation for Java‐
Script programs.
